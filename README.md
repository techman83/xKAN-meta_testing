# xKAN-meta_testing
* `.github/workflows/build-push-image.yml` is used to build new Docker images using `Dockerfile` on push to master.
* `action.yml` is the definition of the GitHub Action, it tells workflows using this action to pull and run the `ksp-ckan/metadata-ci` image.
* The container will install some dependencies and then run `NetKAN/build.sh`.

* This action can be used by putting `NetKAN/ckan-metadata-ci.yml` into the directory `.github/workflows/` of your repository.

# Limitations
Currently only runs the `build.sh` for .netkan files.


# TODO
* Replace both `build.sh`:
  * by a Python rewrite
  * that can handle .ckan and .netkan files in one go
  * that makes less assumptions about the environment, like target branch (->`github.base_ref`), or the location of the .netkan files (create input?)
  * that caches mod downloads in a ways that doesn't overflow the available cache storage
